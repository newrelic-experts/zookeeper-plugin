# New Relic Infrastructure Integration for Zookeeper
New Relic Infrastructure Integration for Zookeeper captures critical performance metrics reported by Zookeeper nodes.

## Disclaimer
New Relic has open-sourced this integration to enable monitoring of this technology. This integration is provided AS-IS WITHOUT WARRANTY OR SUPPORT, although you can report issues and contribute to this integration via GitHub. Support for this integration is available with an [Expert Services subscription](https://newrelic.com/expertservices).

## Requirements
* Apache Zookeeper 3.4 or above

## Installation
* Download an archive file for the Zookeeper Integration
* Place the executables under `bin` directory and the definition file `zookeeper-definition.yml` in `/var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations`
* Set execution permissions for the binary files `nr-zookeeper`
* Place the integration configuration file `zookeeper-config.yml.sample` in `/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d` and update its values.
* Verify the path to  `nc` utility in the  `zookeeper-config.yml`  

```
    arguments:
      host: localhost
      port: 2181
      cmd: /bin/nc  <-- this PATH varies per OS
```

## Usage
This is the description about how to run the Zookeeper Integration with New Relic Infrastructure agent, so it is required to have the agent installed (see [agent installation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/install-infrastructure-linux)).

In order to use the Zookeeper Integration it is required to configure `zookeeper-config.yml.sample` file. Firstly, rename the file to `zookeeper-config.yml`. Then, depending on your needs, specify all instances that you want to monitor. Once this is done, restart the Infrastructure agent.

You can view your data in Insights by creating your own custom NRQL queries. To
do so use **ZookeeperSample** event types.


To validate the metrics collected from Zookeeper, you can run the command below.  

```
$ echo mntr | nc localhost 2181
zk_version	3.4.10-39d3a4f269333c922ed3db283be479f9deacaa0f, built on 03/23/2017 10:13 GMT
zk_avg_latency	0
zk_max_latency	0
zk_min_latency	0
zk_packets_received	14
zk_packets_sent	13
zk_num_alive_connections	1
zk_outstanding_requests	0
zk_server_state	standalone
zk_znode_count	4

zk_ephemerals_count	0
zk_approximate_data_size	27
zk_open_file_descriptor_count	110
zk_max_file_descriptor_count	1048576
```

## Integration development usage
Assuming that you have source code you can build and run the Zookeeper Integration locally.
* Go to directory of the Zookeeper Integration and build it
```bash
$ make
```
* The command above will execute tests for the Zookeeper Integration and build an executable file called `nr-zookeeper` in `bin` directory.
```bash
$ ./bin/nr-zookeeper -port <zookeeper port>
```
* If you want to know more about usage of `./bin/nr-zookeeper` check
```bash
$ ./bin/nr-zookeeper --help
```

For managing external dependencies [govendor tool](https://github.com/kardianos/govendor) is used. It is required to lock all external dependencies to specific version (if possible) into vendor directory.
